Solve these $12$ Groups of $50+$ DP problems to crack & solve any DP problem designed for SDE Interviews. I wish I had this cheatsheet back when I was first switching from Amazon and brushing up on all my DSA basics. 

If you need to count ways, find min/max results, or brute force gives you déjà vu with repeated calculations, you’re looking at a DP problem.

Spot these triggers: “count number of ways,” “min/max value,” “partition,” “longest subsequence/path,” “edit distance,” “minimum cost.”

→ DP is about replacing exponential brute force with $O(n)$ or $O(n^2)$ by caching repeated work.
→ These 12 groups cover every DP type you’ll see in interviews.
